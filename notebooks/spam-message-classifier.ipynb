        "Spam messages are a widespread issue across digital communication platforms, disrupting user experience and trust. This project focuses on building a **spam message classifier** using **RoBERTa**, a state-of-the-art transformer model for natural language understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** to fine-tune RoBERTa for binary spam classification. This provides a strong and generalized spam detection model suitable for various text-based environments.\n",
